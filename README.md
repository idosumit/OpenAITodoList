# AI-powered To-do List App

## Introduction
This project is a simple to-do list application powered by AI, built as a fun weekend project. It's designed to offer a straightforward interface for task management while leveraging AI to enhance functionality. Ideal for personal use or as a base for further development.

## Features
- Basic task management: add, delete, and mark tasks as completed.
- AI-enhanced features for task sorting, prioritization, and suggestions (requires OpenAI API integration).

## Dependencies
- Swift 5+
- Xcode 12+
- iOS 14+
- OpenAI API key for AI features

## Setup
### Requirements
Ensure you have the latest version of Xcode installed to open and run the project. Additionally, you'll need an OpenAI API key to utilize the AI functionalities.

### Configuring Your OpenAI API Key
1. Obtain an API key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/).
2. Navigate to the project's settings in Xcode and find the place to insert your API key. This is typically done in a `.env` file or directly within the code (look for a placeholder within the project files).

### Installation
Open `Taskr.xcodeproj` in Xcode, choose your target device or simulator, and run the project.

## Usage
Once installed, you can start adding tasks to your to-do list. The AI features work in the background to enhance your task management experience. Remember, you need to have your OpenAI API key configured to make use of the AI capabilities.
